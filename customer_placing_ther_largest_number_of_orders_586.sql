SELECT o.customer_number FROM Orders o
GROUP BY o.customer_number
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Example 1:

-- Input: 
-- Orders table:
-- +--------------+-----------------+
-- | order_number | customer_number |
-- +--------------+-----------------+
-- | 1            | 1               |
-- | 2            | 2               |
-- | 3            | 3               |
-- | 4            | 3               |
-- +--------------+-----------------+
-- Output: 
-- +-----------------+
-- | customer_number |
-- +-----------------+
-- | 3               |
-- +-----------------+
-- Explanation: 
-- The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
-- So the result is customer_number 3.
